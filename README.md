### Hi there 👋

<!--
**rizkyrahmadianto/rizkyrahmadianto** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

👋 Hi, I’m Rizky Rahmadianto!  
👀 I’m interested in exploring exploring website developments such as architecture, front-end and backend. Apart from that, software testing.  
🌱 I’m currently learning about full-stack development, especially on websites and learning to become a software tester to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge.  
💞️ Now I'm focusing on studying and exploring software quality assurance at PT. Kasir Pintar Internasional.  
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to shoot me a message on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn.  
⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a full-stack developer and now I am given the opportunity to try new things to become software quality assurance.
